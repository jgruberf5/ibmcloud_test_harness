# F5 Networks BIG-IP™ Virtual Edition Instance Creation using Catalog image

This directory contains the terraform module to create BIG-IP™ VPC Gen2 instances using catalog input from the user.

Use this template to create BIG-IP™ virtual edition instnaces using catalog image from your IBM Cloud account in IBM Cloud [VPC Gen2](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/overview) by using Terraform or IBM Cloud Schematics.  Schematics uses Terraform as the infrastructure-as-code engine.  With this template, you can create and manage infrastructure as a single unit as follows. For more information about how to use this template, see the IBM Cloud [Schematics documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics).

## IBM Cloud IaaS Support

## Prerequisites

- Have access to [Gen 2 VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/).
- The given VPC must have at least one subnet with one IP address unassigned (up to 5 are supported)
- The BIG-IP™ image name can reference the name of a custom image in your region or the public TMOS images available on IBM cloud.

Public BIG-IP™ images available on IBM Cloud are:

**User variable:** ```tmos_image_name```

**Values:**

- ```bigip-14-1-2-6-0-0-2-all-1slot```
- ```bigip-14-1-2-6-0-0-2-ltm-1slot```
- ```bigip-15-1-0-4-0-0-6-all-1slot```
- ```bigip-15-1-0-4-0-0-6-ltm-1slot```

If your regional custom image has the same name as the public image, your custom image will be used.

By default the BIG-IP™ virtual edition instnace will be unlicensed. The user can choose to include the following license types and their required template attributes

**User variable:** ```license_type```

**Values:**

| ```license_type``` value | Description | Other require variables |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| ```none```   | No license activation | None |
| ```byol```   | Bring your own license | ```byol_license_basekey``` |
| ```regkeypool``` | BIG-IQ™ RegKey Pool | ```license_host```, ```license_username```, ```license_password```, ```license_pool``` |
| ```utilitypool``` | BIG-IQ™ Utility Pool (ELA Licensing) | ```license_host```, ```license_username```, ```license_password```, ```license_pool```, ```license_sku_keyword_1```, ```license_sku_keyword_1```, ```license_unit_of_measure``` (optional) |

For pool based license activation, please consult the [BIG-IQ™ Licensing documentation](https://techdocs.f5.com/en-us/bigiq-7-0-0/managing-big-ip-ve-subscriptions-from-big-iq/deploy-license-iq-license-manager.html)

For information on creating custom images for IBM cloud see [TMOS Cloudinit](https://github.com/f5devcentral/tmos-cloudinit)

## Device authentication

The user should create an SSH key in the IBM cloud region. The SSH key name should be included as a user variable.

**User Variable:** ```ssh_key_name```

Once the images completes onboarding, SSH access to the ```root``` user is available on the defined management Floating IP.

The user should also provide an ```admin``` user password.

**User Variable:** ```tmos_admin_password```

If no ```tmos_admin_password``` is provided, a randomized lengthy password will be set. The user can then access the device via SSH authorized key and set the ```admin``` password by using ```passwd admin```.

## Device Network Connectivity

Currently, IBM terraform resources do not provide the ability to obtain VPC subnets by their name. The user will have to know the subnet UUID as input variables.

At least one VPC subnet must be defined:

**User Variable:** ```management_subnet_id```

If only the ```management_subnet_id``` id defined, the BIG-IP™ will be create as a 1NIC instance. The management UI and APIs can then be reached on port 8443 instead of the standard 443.

Up to five network interfaces can be added to a IBM VPC instnace. If you define additional subnet IDs, these will be mapped to BIG-IP™ data interfaces starting with inteface ```1.1```

**User Variables:**

```data_1_1_subnet_id```
```data_1_2_subnet_id```
```data_1_3_subnet_id```
```data_1_4_subnet_id```

## CI Integration via Webhooks

When onboarding is complete, including optional licensing and network interface provisioning, the BIG-IP™ can issue an HTTP(s) POST request to an URL specified by the user.

*User Variables:*

```phone_home_url```

The POST body will be JSON encoded and supply basic instance information:

```json
{
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "product": "BIG-IP",
    "version": "14.1.2.6-0.0.2.0",
    "hostname": "f5-test-ve-01.local",
    "id": "27096838-e85f-11ea-ac1c-feff0b2c5217",
    "management": "10.243.0.7/24",
    "installed_extensions": ["f5-service-discovery", "f5-declarative-onboarding", "f5-appsvcs", "f5-telemetry", "f5-appsvcs-templates"],
    "do_enabled": true,
    "as3_enabled": false,
    "ts_enabled": false,
    "metadata": {
        "template_source": "f5devcentral/tmos-cloudinit/demo/ibmcloud_vpc_gen2/schematics/tmos_multi_nic",
        "template_version": 20200825,
        "zone": "eu-de-1",
        "vpc": "r010-e27c516a-22ff-41f5-96b8-e8ea833fd39f",
        "app_id": "undefined"
    }
}
```

The user can optionally defined an ```app_id``` variable to tie this instnace for reference.

*User Variables:*

```app_id```

Once onboarding is complete, the user can than access the TMOS™ Web UI, use iControl™ REST API endpoints, or utilize the [F5 BIG-IP™ Extensibility Extensions](https://clouddocs.f5.com/) installed.

## Costs

When you apply template, the infrastructure resources that you create incur charges as follows. To clean up the resources, you can [delete your Schematics workspace or your instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-manage-lifecycle#destroy-resources). Removing the workspace or the instance cannot be undone. Make sure that you back up any data that you must keep before you start the deletion process.

*_VPC_: VPC charges are incurred for the infrastructure resources within the VPC, as well as network traffic for internet data transfer. For more information, see [Pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-pricing-for-vpc).

## Dependencies

Before you can apply the template in IBM Cloud, complete the following steps.

1.  Ensure that you have the following permissions in IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management:
    * `Manager` service access role for IBM Cloud Schematics
    * `Operator` platform role for VPC Infrastructure
2.  Ensure the following resources exist in your VPC Gen 2 environment
    - VPC
    - SSH Key
    - VPC with multiple subnets
    - _(Optional):_ A Floating IP Address to assign to the management interface of Ubuntu 18.04 instance post deployment

## Configuring your deployment values

Create a schematics workspace and provide the github repository url (https://github.com/f5devcentral/tmos-cloudinit/tree/master/demo/ibmcloud_vpc_gen2/schematics/tmos_multi_nic) under settings to pull the latest code, so that you can set up your deployment variables from the `Create` page.

## Post F5 BIG-IP™ Virtual Edition Onboarding

1. From the VPC list, confirm the F5 BIG-IP™ Virtual Edition is powered ON with green button
2. From the CLI, run `ssh root@<Floating IP>`.
3. Enter 'yes' for continue connecting using ssh your key. This is the ssh key value, you specified in ssh_key variable.
4. Use the ```tmsh``` shell.
